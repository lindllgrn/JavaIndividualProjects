<h3>Zoo_Keeper_App</h3>
<p>Here are the things this app can do: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The program will ask what the user wants for their zoo name.</li>
  <li>Then, it will take the zoo's name and start creating the user's own zoo!</li>
  <li>The user will be able to choose between two categories:
    <ol>
      <li>Bird</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
    </ol>
  <li>From there, if the user chose Bird they can choose: </li>
    <ol> 
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Sparrow</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Or if they chose Fish they can choose: </li>
    <ol>
      <li>Flying Fish</li>
      <li>Guppy</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Depending on what the user chose, they will be able to enter information based on the questions they are asked.</li>
  <li>All of the information is being stored into an ArrayList, which is used to display all of the input for what all is in their zoo!</li>
