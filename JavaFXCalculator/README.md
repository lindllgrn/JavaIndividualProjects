<h1>Java FX Calculator</h1>
<p>This calculator can do many things a regular calculator can do BUT... <br>
<em>it is able to hold a number into memory so that if a user has a number that they won't<br>
be able to remember, they can store it and keep using it if needed!</em></p>
<p><b>The calculator has a button "MR" that when pressed, will recall the number stored in memory and can be used in whatever way is needed.</b></p>
